# Sentiment Analysis of Mental Health Discussions on Reddit

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit posts related to mental health using Python and the TextBlob library.

# Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the sentiment of mental health-related discussions on Reddit. We make use of the TextBlob library, which is a popular Python library for processing textual data.

The objective is to understand the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the discussions and the level of subjectivity (objective or subjective) in these discussions. The analysis is based on a dataset containing mental health-related posts from various Reddit subreddits.

# Notebook Contents

The Jupyter notebook is divided into five main sections:

Importing Necessary Libraries
Loading the Dataset
Data Preprocessing
Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob
